# Objective

At GridUnity, we’re building the tools that power the future of the electric grid. We’re looking for engineers who think like builders, tinkerers, and architects — people who are passionate about solving complex, impactful problems.

This challenge is intentionally open-ended. Choose a problem that interests you — whether from energy, data, or software architecture — and show us how you approach building something that matters.

We care more about how you think and build than about any particular "_right_" answer.

# Challenge Overview

**Option 1**:

1. Build Something That Could Fit in a Grid Software Ecosystem
   Use your creativity and technical skill to build something that would fit in a modern grid-focused software platform. A few examples:

   - Grid Data Engineering
   - Grid Topology Explorer: Parse and visualize electric transmission line or substation data (e.g., GeoJSON, PSLF, or OpenDSS).
   - Substation Inference Tool: Given transmission line data, build logic to infer missing substation metadata.
   - Load Forecast Simulator: Create a basic forecasting tool using synthetic time-series data for load or generation.

2. Smart Interfaces or Tools
3. AI-Powered Model Parser: Use an LLM or NLP pipeline to extract parameters from power system model files (e.g., PSLF .raw, .dyr).
4. Schematic Uploader: Create an image recognition prototype to extract data from a single-line diagram (SLD).
5. Grid Application Validator: Build a tool that simulates a rules engine for validating energy project application fields.

Developer or Operations Tools

Telemetry Dashboard: Build a UI that ingests and visualizes live (or mocked) power data (e.g., voltage, frequency, or DER status).
Config-as-Code Interface: Design a web UI or CLI tool to manage YAML/JSON config files (e.g., application templates, rule sets).
Audit Trail Viewer: Create a viewer for reviewing field-level data changes and historical revisions (versioned field tracking).

**Option 2**:

Solve a Problem You Care About

Have a side project you’re passionate about? A problem you’ve always wanted to tackle in utilities, developer experience, or system design? Go for it. Just tell us why it matters and how you approached it. Tech Stack (Optional, Use What You Like)
Technologies we often use at GridUnity (but feel free to use your own preferred tools):

Backend: Node.js, TypeScript, Python, PostgreSQL, AWS Lambda
Frontend: React, TypeScript, MUI, Stencil.js (Web Components)
Auth: Auth0, JWT
DevOps: GitLab CI/CD, Terraform, Serverless Framework
AI Tools: OpenAI, HuggingFace, pdfplumber, LangChain, QLoRA

# What to Submit

Please send:

- A GitHub link (or zip file) of your project
- A short README that includes:
- Problem statement
- Why you chose it
- How to run/test it
- Any decisions, tradeoffs, or next steps

**Optional**:

Short demo video (3–5 minutes)
Architecture or flow diagram

What We’re Looking For:

- **Initiative**: Did you explore a problem with curiosity and intention?
- **Craft**: Is the code well-organized, readable, and maintainable?
- **Clarity**: Can you communicate what you built and why?
- **Impact**: Could this idea be useful, novel, or inspiring?
- **Mission Resonance**: Does your thinking reflect a real-world problem in energy, infrastructure, or developer tooling?
